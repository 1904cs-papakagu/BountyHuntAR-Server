        They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my
        life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again,
        bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because,
        you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING! So if you think about it,
        dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. I am
        every character in between, save for that little weirdo with his guts
        strapped in, begging for water. That's not me. So if you think about it,
        dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. Because
        I'm just ... um .... I don't know. Why give an interview when you can
        leave a warning, you know? I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I
        cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and
        obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. But like in
        baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie. Never has. So what we all have is
        a marriage of the heart ... of the hearts. And that was actually, you
        know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin'
        almost a decade.
